# Test Driven Development Starter Kit

This repository contains all the necessary code and dependencies to get started practicing your TDD! 

There are starter files for Java and Groovy tests. 

To get started clone this repository and edit either JavaTests or GroovyTests or alternatively, delete both and start a fresh. There's a default class with one static method there to aid as a starter. Feel free to remove this too. 

Included in this repository is:
* JUnit 5
* Mockito
* Hamcrest

## Running the Tests
`gradle test`

That's about it!
